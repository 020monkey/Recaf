			<h1>Updating and compiling with Java 9+</h1>
			<h2>Why are the release binaries using Java 8?</h2>
			<p>Seeing that Java 8 is still very popular and lots of people have not yet moved to later versions <i>(Let alone know that new versions exist)</i> the builds that are provided on github will be based on Java 8.</p>
			<h2>Compiling</h2>
			<p>The maven configuration file <span class="code">pom.xml</span> has <i>"profiles"</i> that are loaded when you execute it with different versions of Java on your system. These profiles allow maven to determine which version-specific dependencies to download and what flags to send to the compiler. Make sure you have the correct JDK version installed and that it is on your system path.</p>
			<p>After downloading Recaf's source you can compile with <span class="code">mvn package</span>.<br>
			Your compiled jar will be located in: <span class="code">target/recaf-$VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar</span></p>
			<p><b>Note:</b> Only Long-Term-Service (LTS) versions of Java are supported. This means if you are on Java 9/10 you will need to either upgrade to Java 11+ or downgrade to the latest Java 8.</p>
